# ProjectAlice Installer

This repository contains the installer for Project Alice. You can either clone this and run installer.sh or use a more automated way by:

*As of now it gets the project sources from bitbucket which is reserved to testers with access to the repository*

```
wget -O ProjectAlice.sh http://bit.ly/DLProjectAlice
sudo chmod +x ProjectAlice.sh
sudo ./ProjectAlice.sh
```

## If you are interested to be a tester:
- **This is a closed sources project at the moment**. You are not allowed to share the sources, as a whole or parts of it. You will need to electronically sign an NDA
- We are in a state where using still requires some thinkering. Do not apply is you are not ready to spend time on making stuff work for you.
- Not all featured Project Alice are implemented yet and many still need work
- You have general knowledge about linux, dependencies, system configuration, git, bash
- You have python knowledge
- You are ok with the fact that nothing is written in stone and everything is subject to changes, without warning, that may include project configuration or data loss due to deletion, bug etc
- You are to report bugs and experience at least every week
- Your data are only local and nobody has access to anything on your Project Alice install as it does not share any data. At a later point you will be able to share data such as bug reports if you explicitly turn on a configuration
- You understand we are not affiliated with Snips even though some of us have strong connections with the team.
- **Snips is not responsible for anything related to Project Alice** but only for their core components which include snips-tts, snips-asr, snips-asr-google, snips-dialogue, snips-audio-server, snips-satellite, snips-nlu, snips-sam, snips-hotword.
- You are responsible to protect your privacy. Once again, Snips or Project Alice don't share data on the web unless you explicitly decide to use online services. **Privacy doesn't stop at that line!** Change your device default password and chose your passwords wisely for services such as Samba, Google and others. You are the first responsible for your privacy as we do not impose online connectivity.
- There is no hidden costs for using Project Alice. Everything is provided "as is". Using services such as Amazon Polly, Google WaveNet, Google ASR require accounts to be created and usually charge for large amount of data. This costs are not covered by Project Alice and only occure after your acceptance of the said service terms of services.
- You can pm me for being a tester, use the issue tracker or [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/Jfcj355)
- **As a final point** I'd like to add that ProjectAlice is running by at least 4 devs at the moment and works when we do not brake everything with a rushed git commit/push.
