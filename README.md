# ProjectAlice
Project Alice is a smart home assistant completly based on [Snips](https://snips.ai) that is modular and extensible


# Again, another assistant?
Yes, but this one has a big advantage: Using Snips for the voice recognition and language understanding, you are guaranteed your privacy comes first! Why? Well, Snips simply runs on device and totally offline! Your speech isn't just silver for the big online voice processing companies such as Google, Apple or Amazon, it's gold! Keep your furtune, keep your words at home!


# Who made this?
The original code was started end 2015 and several rewrite made it what it is today. It was entirely written by me Psycho until this point, where I decided to open it to the world. There's no money asked, no contribution, but as the license states, you should give back what you've been given, share your improvements and addons to the rest of us, in the form of pull requests.


# Project Alice, as in "Resident Evil", isn't that scary?
Ok, yes, I do admit it may sound scary, but you have my word none of you will die down here. I really like the red queen in that movie/game serie and I decided to name the assistant Alice, which lead to my project, Project Alice.


# Where does it run?
Well, it's written in Python, but it's been made for Snips that is meant for Raspberry. So this pretty limits the choise. A raspberry 3, 3b or 3b+ for the main unit is a good choice
